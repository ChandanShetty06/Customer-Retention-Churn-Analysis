# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis 📊

![Dashboard Cover](./Cover%20Page.jpg)

## 📋 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for a telecommunications company. By leveraging Power BI, this interactive dashboard identifies key risk factors, customer demographics, and service patterns that contribute to customer attrition.

The goal is to provide actionable insights that help the retention team reduce churn rates and improve customer lifetime value (CLV).

## 🚀 Key Insights
Based on the analysis of the **Main Dashboard**, several critical trends were identified:
* **Contract Type:** Customers on "Month-to-Month" contracts show a significantly higher churn rate compared to long-term contracts.
* **Payment Methods:** Electronic check users are more likely to churn than those using automated payment methods.
* **Service Impact:** Customers without Tech Support or Online Security services have higher attrition rates.
* **Demographics:** Senior citizens and customers without dependents exhibit specific churn behaviors that require targeted retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Power BI Desktop:** For data transformation (Power Query), modeling, and visualization.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used for creating custom measures such as Churn Rate %, Total Customers, and Revenue Loss.
* **Dataset:** Telecom customer data (demographics, account info, and service usage).
